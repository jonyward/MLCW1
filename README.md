# Machine Learning Coursework 1

This application uses numpy, pandas, and sklearn to create a classifier using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Alorgithm, to determine the outcome of a game of League of Legends.

Data used in the first minute of thousands of games were used, with whether a team lost or won a game being used as target data to train the classifier. 

Once a classifier was created, a Grid Search was used to tune the model making the prediction more accurate.

## Requirements:

```bash
    pip install numpy
    pip install pandas
    pip install sklearn
```

## Running the application:

```bash
    py script.py
```
